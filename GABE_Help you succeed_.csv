Make time for us to catch up and less pressure . Unfortunately I can't perform a maricle.. i need time. To know python it takes  time.. i can't know in a day. 
so far so good with all resources provided
By doing some revisions sometimes and having quizzes
Make sure all the students understand before moving to the nexr chapter
So far I'm satisfied with the help I am getting
The Python sprint week of study should be increased to at least 8 weeks
Being supportive
"I cannot think of something right, our pod leader has been helpful."
cover more challenging content and exercises.
What we have at the moment is enough
I would say that the pacing be a little less rigid. I also would like 
Giving more exercises to do 
Slow down with the weekly test as we cannot cope as some of us received laptops late and still new to this coding 
Words of encouragement
You are doing a great job already. 
More webinars during the week that maybe go for 2 hours
1. Extend the time period on webinars and PODS. 2. Do a catch up session for Powerbi as we did not have laptops during that time.
"If my response in my explanation of the question regarding more insight to my opinion on webinars can be considered for future webinars, I believe this would cement certain concepts in Explorers significantly better. Thanks for taking the time to read my responses."
GO more in detail with the theory and course content. It will supplement and speed up the learning process especially because the sprint are time based. the learning
more practise
"You are providing the necessary already, but i'll say yes to more learning videos."
Make the webinars more detailed. I feel some are rushed. 
"So far I think there is sufficient support, information and resources."
Can you extend the python sprint by 1 week ðŸ˜¥ to help us catch up with the pacing. The statistics has and is taking some extra time for us to fully grasp the concept.
"Provide prescribed text because at times i feel  like I am consulting many sources trying to find the best, which ends being quite overwhelming."
"I think picking me randomly from a group to speak out, so that I fight/defeat fear which will play a huge impact in building my confidence, character & communication."
"I'm one of the students that opted for a laptop and since receiving one, I have been struggling to catch up a bit with the Python coursework. I could not do any coding challenges prior to that and scored 0. Seeing that some of the memo's are already out, I'm not sure will I still get points for those coding challenges I couldn't do because of the laptop situation."
Offer more assistance to students struggling to keep up with the coursework. Extend due dates for the Python coding challenges as some of us just got laptops recently and are still struggling to make sense of things.
Supplementary resources for understanding concepts 
Important concepts deserve a deeper dive.
More pod sessions and mcqs to test the knowledge I gained and if I understand.
giving more course info on athena
Providing a practical notebook train on Athena to accompany each webinar that presents a new topic / concept.
"By suggesting more materials that I can learn from, and I feel like the pacing is too fast."
There is no flaw really from your end
Can I have have a study partner.
Can I have a study partner please.
I will be okay.
add more practical videos eg. live coding that is relevant to our studies
"Please go over this python statistics sometime, it's quite complicated "
Sharing videos or documents to bridge the gap nit covered ie the basics 
not having to much pressure
"I recently got an 'at-risk' mail, and I am worried. I'm not sure Explore can give me what I need to cover up without affecting the general pacing - which is some extra time. I lost some ground while I was indisposed, and recovery has been slow. But I am determined to make it despite."
"Grace, check ins"
more webinars
"I need more clarity on statistics and probability, some sort of a summary of everything we've covered. "
I think its on me now
Each concept should be broken down into simple trains all the way. I know the aiim is to encourage research and helping us become gritty but skiping concept doesn't help. 
Keep responding to our queries
I am happy with the level of help that is available from the facilitators and the pod leaders so far
I believe we have been provided with enough resources to ensure we succeed.
I think so far I just need to be motivated enough to do my own research
Communication
"Have more POD sessions were we do practical coding examples and also get extra structured tutorials, even if they are not for marks that is fine, but tutrorials that will be marked and explained how to do them "
I think more practice problems
I thing basics should be polished a little bit because it is hard to start a new concept without any basics
content should be in depth
More activities to refine the skills especially regarding python 
Have more sessions(webinars) on sprints we do not understand and break down the topic
I need more practical section
Have more sessions in stats
"Don't let webinars to go overtime, record pod meetings."
the available support structures seem sufficient to me.
More sessions where a few people gather for a certain lesson eg. How to tackle coding challenges in more depth.
So far so good. The problems I have are of my own creation.
Provide more materials like dataquest
Have more detailed feedback on assesments
I think we are on the right track
By doing more YouTube videos 
every module should take about two weeks to finish and submissions to be done after two weeks also
Continue releasing the walkthroughs and webinars
More webinars and helpful sessions
"You have given me all the needed platforms to rise, I fell back because I discovered if don't build from the scratch I wouldn't be able to progress further. All I need to do now is double up."
I think you've provided all I need to succeed 
"My problem is on the challenges when we dont get some of the code, I think if we get to do some corrections or get a feedback on the code challenges will keep me going since I will get to know my mistakes from the feedback."
creating  basic videos toward new concept
"I think i need more help because other challenge needs the person who did mathematics unlike me i did'nt do mathematics at school i was doing maths literacy so I'm not familiar with statistics so it really challenging and overwhelming ,"
"Make waiting time to query response as short as possible, it helps keep the candidate in the loop and understanding every step. (Call this an exponential comment ;-))"
Pulse check is a great stepping stone
You are doing just enough :)
By providing more in-depth material to go through on my own
"So far I feel supported through Webinars and POD sessions where we are able to discuss our challenges and issues, and if this support is continued, it will help me succeed."
The recordings of webinars and additional resources are very helpful.
The technical content should be bite-size (i.e. 5 minute video and/or one slide) and followed with short quizzes to re-enforce learning and understanding.
"I believe you are doing everything I would require to succeed, it is up to me to practice and apply what I have learnt."
continuing to provide reassurances
"offer one on one sessions in pod sessions for those that are interested especially ones that have no prior knowledge. Example, struggle with python a lot. but i only found out recently that there are practice exercises which are concise and highly effective. "
More interactive sessions during webinars like Slido 
So far I think I am well
increase time line
I would suggest tutorial homeworks in pod sessions where we go through it together with the pod facilitator
Continue as is
So far the explore team is doing a great job. Please don't stop or minimize the webinars or POD sessions.. They are really helpful
considering the fast pace.
Inclusion of some more practice problems to master the fundamentals could be helpful
I would like to at least have one on one interactions at least once a week if possible with the head teacher to go through whatever concepts I did not understand from that week's work. Especially the coding part of the course
I am happy so far
Continue with the current level of support
A sprint dedicated to probability theory and statistics
provide more coding exercises or sites
"You can pair us in micro group, possibly attach two pd member to nudge on each other when there's a meeting and serves as accountability partner."
I think currently the help I get is all I need
Can't think of anything more than what you are already providing.
"Provide valuable video link for better understanding, most of us learn through video rather than text"

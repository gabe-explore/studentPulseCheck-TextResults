Python is difficult  for me and is hard for me to catch up. Time period is so small.  And some of us the delay of laptops cost us..
Working with other students who are not willing to put an effort
The main challenge to me was that most of the things are new to me and therefore I have to try and work an extra mile and practice more often.
Time management
At times Network is a problem
Not getting the challenge correctly
I have power issues in my area and thus my time spent on Athena has decreased.
"Some of the content is high level, but sometime the resources do help. "
I feel like the lessons are rushed a lot.
Load shedding
"I have been struggling with Python programming language, I am unable to meet up with the recommended pacing, so on many days, I'm almost discouraged already!"
Python statistics is a bit challenging on my side as I didnt do well on the mcq
Fast pacing of the course since we received laptops late
Nothing aside the common network issues
Load shedding
"Loadshedding, fear of looking dumb "
Powerbi visualization
Statistics has been the first roadblock. Not the understanding of the concepts but rather the application of it within the context of Python and the examples provided. I think more guided solutions and multiple questions with regards to the given examples (i.e. probability of a certain height) would further cement one's understanding of the concepts that need to be extracted. As opposed to finding a single answer (e.g. what's the probability of 1.7m?) of a particular scenario and then moving on to a new scenario.
The course content made available on Athena is very limited and requires one to find other sources to learn which can be quite time consuming especially for beginners. 
so far I'm managing there are no challenges
More attention should be giving to those without any prior coding experience. 
I will suggest we are given a roadmap to follow if possible. Like what to focus on and what next after that.
"Sometimes imposter syndrome kicks in, especially when it feels like there isn't sufficient time to get things done."
1 thing for me would be time. Managing explore and all the other  commitments I have had been an uphill task.
I feel the pace is quite fast.
"It might be the workload, nevertheless it is my responsibility. Nothing blocks me from success so far."
Time management and feeling overwhelmed by the amount of coursework that we are expected to do within a certain period of time.
Rushing to do coding challenges without understanding the content
Applying concepts to problems 
Some concepts are not fully dissected.
Coding challenges 
the course is really going on a fast pace.
Relearning statistics fundamentals from scratch. 
Learning at a faster pase
Not really a challenge but the fact that everyone here is not on the same level. We have some that are far better than others
Being up to date with the programme and understanding the concepts.
Not getting good marks and not being on par with the programme.
python and statistics
lack of videos and demonstration under python
my inability to juggle activities
Short time to grasp new concepts 
starting new things from the start with not having enough time to learn it
Ill-health and limited finances
"Power, Time"
The content on Athena is not enough but its nothing that cant be fixed with more research and google.
Statistics and probability 
understanding all the terms and new concepts at once. integrating all these new things 
The content are not granular in seperate components compared to the BI course
"Statistics, even though I am getting it gradually "
some of the pacing - with having to source additional resources to learn about some baseline information
Nothing so far.
The difficulty level of Python and the somewhat fast pace of the programme
Time management
Time and understanding the material 
So far nothing has been challenging
The basics are not so basic.
some of the content provided are not in depth 
The lack of context for some of the practical things. 
Power outages
Light and economy issues (as a Nigerian)
Statistics
"I sometimes get lost within the webinars, especially when they take long."
"There's a lot of things happening all at once. It's not a hindrance, however it contributes to an overwhelming feeling."
I would like more resources to learn from on Athena
Inconsistent attendance of pod sessions an webinars which doesn't allow me to ask questions in real time.
Time management
"Time , sometimes it is a lot of work over a short period of time"
code challenges and statistics in code challenges a code will be running correctly on notebook and marked wrong by the report card it is confusing on statistics it is a matter of looking for more materials until I get it 
Time management 
Time
having to figure everything out on your own
Python 
 Understanding of the basics in python 
My time. Trying to strike the balance between my part time teaching job and the classes. 
Statistics for Data Science
battling with some code challenges but I am definitely getting better  
Python challenges
Continuous distributions
too many live webinars
Pacing- course not really beginner friendly
Loadshedding 
"The content in the trains alone is not enough. I have been able to overcome that through external research so I can't say it is really a roadblock right now, but it was at the start. No other challenges so far."
Sometimes the pod meetings happen during loadshedding. 
The technical contents is not reach enough to prepare me for the code challenge. I have toto consult external resources to do code challenges and assignments. 
Nothing as of yet.
balancing coursework and work
"The short video trains are somewhat helpful, although the same thing will be repeated. The webinars should atleast be add  onto the video."
Python coding challenges 
Keeping up since itâ€™s new content 
Timeline
"The coding material is insufficient. Heavily dependant on external sources to aid in completing coding challenges, which is very time consuming."
Pacing
"Timing! Everything EDSA is fast paced. I understand that the idea is for us to push the edge of what we think is possible. However, because I am new to everything data science, I spend so much time learning and minimal time practicing the things I have learned. No one wants to fall behind, so there is the struggle to quickly grasps as much knowledge as I can for each topic, while trying to complete the code challenges(which I love, cos its practical), predicts and MCQs. Can we get an extra week (called extra study week) in each sprint?"
the pacing at times is overwhelming
"I tend to be a perfectionist, and focussing on obtaining a perfect score sometimes get in the way of learning by making mistakes. Also, sometimes the MCQ questions are phrased in an ambiguous way "
"As someone who is new to coding, I find that time is not on my side because it takes me a long time to understand the coding challenges so I am almost always behind of my schedule."
"Lack of basic concepts on Athena (eg. Dictionaries, for and while loops)"
Coursework being released at a different pace to the pacing
probability theory
There is too much to do in a short space of time
The time constraint
balancing time for Athena content and gaining knowledge from external resources 
Nothing
Not enough video learning resources for statistics and probability
